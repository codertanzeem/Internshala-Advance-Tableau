# PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->
## Problem Statement:
Design an interactive and visually informative dashboard using Tableau to present the sales data for a bike shop named "The Bike Haven."

## Description:
In the vibrant city of San Francisco, a small yet dedicated bike shop called "The Bike Haven" operates, offering a variety of products such as bikes, clothing, accessories, and components. The shop was founded by John, a cycling enthusiast whose passion for bikes began in his youth. Growing up in a small town, John developed a deep love for cycling, spending countless hours tinkering with his bike to make it faster and more efficient. His dedication to the sport led him to become a competitive cyclist, winning numerous local races and even competing internationally.

After several years of racing, John decided to retire from competition and channel his passion for bikes into a new venture. He opened The Bike Haven, a small shop dedicated to selling high-quality bikes and accessories to fellow cycling enthusiasts. Initially, the business struggled, and John found it difficult to make ends meet. However, he remained determined, working tirelessly to establish his shop as a trusted name in the cycling community. As word spread about the exceptional products and customer service at The Bike Haven, the shop began to attract a loyal customer base. John's extensive knowledge and love for bikes enabled him to provide expert advice on everything from bike maintenance to selecting the perfect bike for each customer's needs. Over time, The Bike Haven grew in popularity, becoming the go-to destination for serious cyclists in the city.

Today, The Bike Haven is a thriving business, offering a diverse range of products, including bikes, clothing, accessories, and components. John has even expanded his operations by opening a second shop in a nearby town. His business continues to grow, driven by his commitment to providing the best products and advice to cycling enthusiasts. The Bike Haven stands as a testament to John's passion for cycling and his desire to inspire others to embrace the sport.

Chris, the sales manager at The Bike Haven, shares John's dedication to the business and is determined to take it to new heights. Recognizing the exceptional quality of the products, Chris set out to revamp the company's sales strategy, introduce new products, and implement significant changes to marketing and branding efforts. He conducted thorough market research to understand customer preferences and introduced products tailored to their needs. With the support of a successful marketing team, Chris launched several campaigns that significantly increased the company's visibility and reach. As a result, sales figures began to rise steadily, attracting more customers not only for the quality of the products but also for the outstanding customer service provided by Chris and his team.

Recently, Chris identified a need to update the company's sales reports. The existing reports were static and lacked insight into sales performance. Understanding the importance of visual dashboards, Chris decided to transition from static reports to interactive dashboards. To achieve this, he hired you as a Business Intelligence analyst. In an email, Chris outlined his requirements as follows:

Greetings,

We're excited to enhance our online sales reports by moving from static reports to interactive dashboards. Our primary focus is to track the sales volume of products, clients, and timelines. It would be beneficial to have filters that allow sales representatives to view data specific to their customers and products. I've attached a budget spreadsheet for 2023, which we use to compare actual performance against our projections. Typically, we analyze sales data from the previous two years.

## Task:

Welcome to the team at The Bike Haven! We're looking forward to your contributions to help us elevate our business. Your task is to create an interactive and informative dashboard that will provide a clear understanding of our sales figures. I want to see the performance of each product category, identify the top-selling products, and determine which items require more attention. Additionally, I'd like to compare our sales figures with the previous year and identify our most successful months.

The dashboard should be user-friendly, with visually appealing charts, graphs, and tables that are easy to interpret. It should also be accessible on any device, including laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

The dashboard should include the following visualizations:

* Top 10 Products by Sales Amount: Identify the products generating the most revenue.
* Top 10 Customers: Recognize the most valuable customers and focus on building long-term relationships.
* Sales Figures vs. Budget: Compare actual sales figures to budgeted sales for each month to identify areas needing improvement.
* Sales Figures by Region/City: Use a chart or map to identify regional trends or growth opportunities.
* Product Categories vs. Sales Amount: Analyze how each product category is performing to identify high-revenue areas and those requiring more focus.


Final Task:
Once you've created the dashboard, you will need to record a video demonstrating its interactivity and the functionality of the filters. This video will showcase how the dashboard responds to user actions and provide insight into the effectiveness of the filters. The video should be uploaded to your Google Drive or YouTube channel, and the link should be shared with us. Additionally, upload the PDF of the dashboard to your drive, and include both links (to the dashboard and video) in a Word or PDF file to be shared with us.
